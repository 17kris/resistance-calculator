TR = (sum of all AR)
AR = (ASW + WT) * SR







TR = total resistance
AR = axle resistance
ASW = axle static weight
WT = weight transfer
SR = surface resistance


information we need:
    number of axles present
    weight of each axle
    type of resistance for each axle:
        rolling hard  (.05)
        rolling soft  (.15)
        damaged       (.666)
        mire tire depth (.75)
        mire wheel depth (1.0)
        mire body depth (1.5)
    gradient (angle of pull)  (0-45 degrees):
        0 (flat) = 0
        15       = .25
        30       = .5
        45       = .75
        >45      = 1.0
    directon of pull (up or down)
